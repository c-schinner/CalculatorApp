# CalculatorApp
This project added in a lot of features, using a dictionary to store my calculator values(operations) and have them callable by the user for whatever calulation is needed.
I also have a logo for the start of the app (which was found online) to add a little more personality to the app.
and each math operation is in a function for easy repeatabiltiy.
